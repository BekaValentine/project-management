## Detailed Overview

This is a detailed-enough overview that someone who is starting to contribute to this project can get up to speed without having to ask questions. If this section gets very long, it can be split off into a direction in `library/`, as a resource for people to use, and an intro to that content should be put here instead.

## Other Information

This is where we might link to a github repo, or to some other relevant information that is essential to do any work on the project. This information can also be stored in `library/`, but the presence of it, and its location there, should be noted here for people to find.

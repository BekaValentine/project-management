# Inbox

This is where we would put new information that needs to be addressed and incorporated into the project somehow. Below is a list of inbox items to be dealt with.

When reviewing things to this list, it's important to consider the following questions tree:

- Is the item actionable right now?
  - If so:

    - If item can be done in <=2 minutes: DO IT RIGHT NOW.
    - If it must be delegated to someone outside the project: delegate and add info to task tree (and `delegations.md`, if needed)
    - If item can only be done at a specific time:
    - OTHERWISE: Add the item to the task tree. If it's multistep, note this in the task's comments, and maybe give a few of the steps, but don't spend more than 2 minutes analyzing the issue.


  - If not:

    - If the item is trash: discard item
    - If item is reference material: put in in `library/` as needed.

## Inbox Items

- Adafruit has released a hackable payphone kit. Should we consider buying it instead of continuing this project? Or perhaps we want to continue this project because it's a learning experience? What other things are relevant?
